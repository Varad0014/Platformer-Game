# Platformer Game
This is a Platformer Game created using Pygame. This game features a player navigating through three challenging levels, collecting coins, avoiding enemies, and reaching the exit door to progress to the next level. The game utilizes object-oriented programming practices in Python for clean and modular code. This was a course project done as a way to learn and play around with Pygame.

## Features
- Three challenging levels with increasing difficulty.
- Control the player with keyboard-based movements using the left arrow key for backward, right arrow key for forward, and spacebar for jumping.
- Coin collection to score points.
- Avoid enemies and stay alive with just three lives per level.
- Progress to the next level by reaching the exit door.
